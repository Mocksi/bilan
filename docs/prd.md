# Product Requirements Document
**Bilan: Open Source Trust Analytics for AI Products**
*Making AI user experience failures visible and fixable*

## Executive Summary
AI-powered products lose users when suggestions feel wrong, but teams have no way to see this happening in real-time. Bilan gives developers and product teams trust analytics for AI features through a two-tier model: **open source for individual developers** and **managed platform for teams**.

## User Problems We're Solving

### Primary User: Individual Developer building AI features

**Current State Pain Points:**
- **"I have no idea if my AI features actually help users"** - No feedback loop on AI effectiveness
- **"Users try AI once, then ignore it"** - No visibility into why adoption fails
- **"I'm flying blind on AI UX"** - No instrumentation for AI user experience
- **"Demo works great but users don't engage"** - Disconnect between development and reality

**Desired Future State:**
- See basic trust metrics for AI features locally
- Understand user reaction patterns
- Get simple analytics without external dependencies
- Easy integration that doesn't slow down development

### Secondary User: Product Manager at AI-powered startup/team

**Current State Pain Points:**
- **"Our demos keep failing in production"** - AI suggestions work in testing but fail with real users
- **"I can't see which AI features frustrate users"** - No team-wide visibility into AI satisfaction
- **"Fixing AI is pure guesswork"** - No data-driven way to improve AI features
- **"Support tickets are our only signal"** - By the time users complain, they've already decided to avoid the feature

**Desired Future State:**
- See AI trust/satisfaction across the team in real-time
- Know exactly which prompts/models cause user frustration
- Make data-driven decisions about AI investments
- Advanced routing and ML-powered insights

## User Stories (Priority Order)

### Open Source MVP (Individual Developer)
**As a developer, I want to track user feedback on my AI features locally, so I can improve them without external dependencies.**

- As a developer, I want to install a lightweight SDK (<5KB), so I don't slow down my app
- As a developer, I want to track thumbs up/down locally, so I can see basic user reactions
- As a developer, I want simple analytics in a dashboard, so I can visualize feedback trends
- As a developer, I want to self-host everything, so I control my data and have no ongoing costs

### Managed Platform (Team/Product Focus)
**As a PM, I want advanced AI trust analytics for our team, so I can make data-driven decisions about our AI features.**

- As a PM, I want to see trust scores across all team members, so I can spot patterns
- As a PM, I want alerts when trust drops suddenly, so I can investigate immediately
- As a PM, I want to drill down by customer/segment, so I can understand usage patterns
- As a PM, I want automated model routing based on trust, so our AI self-improves

## Assumptions & Risks

### Key Assumptions
- Developers want AI observability but won't pay initially
- Teams will upgrade from open source when they see value
- Open source adoption drives managed platform sales
- Trust scoring algorithms don't need to be secret sauce

### Biggest Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Low open source adoption | No funnel to paid | Focus on developer experience, useful features |
| Teams stay on open source | Low conversion | Clear value gap, enterprise needs |
| Community doesn't contribute | Slow development | Active maintainership, good docs |
| Competitors copy open source | Loss of differentiation | Managed platform moat, community advantage |
