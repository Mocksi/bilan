# Bilan Project Rules - Trust Analytics for AI Products

## Project Overview
Bilan is an open-source TypeScript SDK + managed analytics platform that helps teams monitor and improve user trust in AI features. Think "Sentry for AI" - real-time trust scoring, automatic model routing, and actionable insights.

## Tech Stack & Architecture
- **Monorepo**: packages/* (SDK, types, examples) + apps/* (api, dashboard, workers)
- **SDK**: TypeScript, Rollup, Vitest, <5KB bundle size
- **API**: Fastify, ClickHouse, Railway deployment
- **Workers**: Cloudflare Workers + KV for scoring and routing
- **Dashboard**: Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, Vercel deployment
- **Database**: ClickHouse Cloud for event storage and aggregation

## Core Principles

### Developer Experience First
- Integration must be <10 minutes from npm install to first data
- TypeScript-first with full type safety and autocompletion
- Zero config defaults, progressive enhancement
- Bundle size <5KB gzipped for SDK
- Error messages should be actionable and helpful

### Performance Standards
- API response time: <20ms P99
- Trust score updates: 60 seconds max
- Dashboard load time: <2 seconds
- SDK initialization: <100ms

### Open Source + Managed Platform
- SDK is MIT licensed, fully open source
- Backend services are proprietary but offer generous free tier
- All types and interfaces must be exported
- Examples should be production-ready

## Code Style & Standards

### TypeScript
- Use strict mode, enable all strict flags
- Prefer interfaces over types for public APIs
- Use branded types for IDs (e.g., `type UserId = string & { __brand: 'UserId' }`)
- Export all public interfaces and types
- Use JSDoc for public API documentation

### React/Next.js
- Use App Router (not Pages Router)
- Prefer server components when possible
- Use TypeScript with React.FC for components
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use Tailwind for styling, avoid custom CSS

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints with consistent naming
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Include request/response types
- Implement proper error handling with structured error responses
- Use Bearer token authentication

### Database (ClickHouse)
- Use MergeTree engine for events table
- Optimize for time-series queries
- Use LowCardinality for enum-like fields
- Implement proper partitioning by date
- Use async inserts for performance

## File Structure & Naming

### Monorepo Structure
```
packages/
├── sdk/          # @bilan/sdk - Main TypeScript SDK
├── types/        # Shared TypeScript types
└── examples/     # Integration examples (nextjs, react, etc.)

apps/
├── api/          # Fastify API for event ingestion
├── dashboard/    # Next.js analytics dashboard
├── scoring-worker/ # Cloudflare Worker for trust scoring
└── router/       # Cloudflare Worker for model routing
```

### Naming Conventions
- Use kebab-case for directories and files
- Use PascalCase for React components
- Use camelCase for functions and variables
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Prefix interfaces with 'I' only for internal types

## GitHub Templates & PR/Issue Standards

### Pull Request Format
- Follow the template in `.github/pull_request_template.md`
- Required sections: Description, Type of Change, Testing, Bundle Size Impact
- Always include bundle size impact for SDK changes

## SDK-Specific Rules

### Public API Design
- Keep surface area minimal, focus on core use cases
- Use method chaining where appropriate
- Provide both imperative and declarative APIs
- Include TypeScript definitions in bundle
- Support both ESM and CommonJS

### Error Handling
- Never throw errors, always handle gracefully
- Use console.warn for non-critical issues
- Provide debug mode for development
- Queue events if initialization is pending

### Bundle Optimization
- Use tree-shaking friendly exports
- Minimize dependencies (prefer native APIs)
- Use dynamic imports for optional features
- Implement proper code splitting

## Testing Standards

### Unit Tests
- Use Vitest for all testing
- Aim for >90% code coverage
- Test public APIs thoroughly
- Mock external dependencies
- Use descriptive test names

### Integration Tests
- Test full event flow (SDK → API → Database)
- Verify trust score calculations
- Test routing decisions
- Validate dashboard displays

## Security Guidelines

### API Security
- Validate all inputs with proper sanitization
- Implement rate limiting (100 req/min per key)
- Use HTTPS everywhere
- Separate public and private API keys
- Log security events

### Data Privacy
- Never log sensitive user data
- Implement proper data retention policies

- Implement proper indexing strategies
- Use async processing for heavy operations
- Monitor query performance

## Domain-Specific Guidelines

### Trust Scoring
- Scores must be between 0 and 1
- Use weighted averages for historical data
- Implement decay functions for old signals
- Provide confidence intervals

### Event Processing
- Use consistent event schemas
- Implement proper deduplication
- Support batch processing
- Handle out-of-order events

### AI Integration
- Support multiple AI providers

## Common Patterns

### Error Handling Pattern
```typescript
try {
  await riskyOperation()
} catch (error) {
  if (this.config.debug) {
    console.error('Bilan SDK error:', error)
  }
  // Continue gracefully
}
```

### Event Schema Pattern
```typescript
interface BaseEvent {
  id: string
  timestamp: number
  userId: string
  metadata?: Record<string, any>
}
```

### API Response Pattern
```typescript
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  success: boolean
  data?: T
  error?: {
    code: string
    message: string
  }
}
```

## Dependencies to Avoid
- Large utility libraries (lodash, moment.js)
- jQuery or other DOM manipulation libraries
- Heavy framework dependencies in SDK
- Unmaintained or deprecated packages

## Preferred Libraries
- **Date handling**: native Date API or date-fns
- **HTTP requests**: native fetch API
- **Testing**: Vitest, @testing-library
- **Build tools**: Rollup, Vite, esbuild
- **Type checking**: TypeScript strict mode

## Environment Variables
- Use descriptive names with BILAN_ prefix
- Provide defaults for development
- Document all required variables
- Use type-safe environment validation

## Git & Deployment
- Use conventional commits
- Squash feature branches before merging
- Tag releases with semantic versioning
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Deploy SDK to npm, services to respective platforms

## Git Commit Best Practices

### Conventional Commits Format
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commit Types
- **feat**: New feature for users
- **fix**: Bug fix for users  
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks (deps, CI, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)

### Subject Line Rules (50 Characters Max)
- Use imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Don't capitalize the first letter after type:
- No period at the end
- Be specific and descriptive

### Examples of Good vs Bad Commits

#### ✅ Good - Atomic Commits
```
feat: add maxItems constraint to events API
fix: resolve npm workspace protocol in CI  
docs: add environment variable documentation
chore: bump SDK version to 0.3.1
refactor: extract database mapping logic
test: add integration tests for vote events
```

#### ❌ Bad - Non-Atomic Commits
```
feat: enhance project structure and documentation
fix: update everything and fix CI issues
chore: misc updates and improvements
```

### Commit Body Guidelines (72 Characters Per Line)
- Explain **why** the change was made, not just what
- Include context about the problem being solved
- Reference issues when applicable
- Use bullet points for multiple changes (if unavoidable)

### Example of Well-Formatted Commit
```
fix: resolve workspace protocol error in CI

npm versions < 7 don't support the workspace:* protocol used in
package.json dependencies. This was causing CI failures with
"Unsupported URL Type" errors.

- Use npx npm@9 ci to explicitly use npm v9+ 
- Ensures workspace protocol support during dependency installation
- Removes reliance on shell session picking up global npm upgrade

Fixes #123
```

### Atomic Commit Strategy
- **One logical change per commit** - easier to review and revert
- **Separate concerns**: Don't mix documentation updates with code changes
- **Split large features**: Break into logical, buildable steps
- **Test each commit**: Every commit should leave the code in a working state

### Before Merging Feature Branches
```bash
# Clean up commit history with interactive rebase
git rebase -i main

# Or use GitHub's "Squash and merge" for smaller features
# But preserve meaningful commit history for larger features
```

### What NOT to Commit Together
❌ Documentation + code changes  
❌ Multiple unrelated bug fixes  
❌ Feature + refactoring + bug fix  
❌ Config changes + new features  

### What CAN Be Committed Together  
✅ Related test + implementation  
✅ Type definitions + implementation  
✅ Multiple files for same logical change  
✅ Breaking change + migration guide  

### Commit Message Templates
```bash
# Set up a commit template
git config commit.template ~/.gitmessage

# Example ~/.gitmessage:
# <type>: <subject>
# 
# Why this change is needed:
# 
# How it addresses the problem:
# 
# Any breaking changes or migration notes:
```

## Final Notes
- Always consider the developer experience impact
- Performance is a feature, not an afterthought
- Maintain backward compatibility in public APIs
- Document breaking changes thoroughly
- Focus on solving real user problems, not building features
